# Permutation

## Abstract

Mathematicians define a permutation as follows:

> "[...] the notion of permutation relates to the act of permuting, or rearranging, members of a set into a particular sequence or order (unlike combinations, which are selections that disregard order). For example, there are six permutations of the set {1,2,3}, namely (1,2,3), (1,3,2), (2,1,3), (2,3,1), (3,1,2), and (3,2,1)." [1]

This package provides tools for managing permutations - for the time it just provides one tool for creating permutations.
